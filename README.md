## 🌸 About Me
I'm a graduate of **English Literature**, but I’ve discovered a deep passion for **programming**, especially **Python** 🐍.  
Even though I’m still learning — with **27 lessons left** to complete my Python course — I’m enjoying every step of the journey.  

I’m also studying **Harvard’s CS50 course**, which is helping me understand how computers and programs really work.  
My dream is to **master Python** and use it to build creative, useful, and meaningful projects in the future.  

> ✨ *I may still be learning, but I’m building my foundation for something great.*
